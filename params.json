{"name":"V-ol3","tagline":"Vaadin OpenLayers 3 wrapper","body":"# Open Layers 3 wrapper for Vaadin 7\r\n\r\nThis project provides GWT and Vaadin 7 wrappers for a subset of features in the OpenLayers 3 JavaScript api. The project is a multi module Maven project with separate modules for the GWT and Vaadin wrapper.\r\n\r\nThe GWT wrapper uses JavaScript overlays to integrate with the underlying OpenLayers JavaScript library. The api provided by the GWT wrapper is in turn utilized by the Vaadin wrapper.\r\n\r\nAs said, only a subset of the features of the OpenLayers 3 library is wrapped. It should be relatively easy to add support for more features, though.\r\n\r\n If you need some features that are not supported at the moment or find a bug in the wrapper, please let me know. Patches and pull requests are also very welcome.\r\n\r\nLicense: Apache License 2.0\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
